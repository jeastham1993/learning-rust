# Learning Rust

Historically, I've always worked with .NET. An object orientated language. This repo is my central place to challenge this OOP view on the world and start working with a different language.

As Rust is intended as a C/C++ like language, isn't particularly object orientated and generally couldn't possibly be further from .NET it seemed a logical choice. Throw in the performance, especially in resource constrained environments, and my serverless brain is intrigued.
